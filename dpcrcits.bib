Within the past 5 years, {EVs} have emerged as a promising minimally invasive novel source of material for molecular diagnostics. Although {EVs} can be easily identified and collected from biological fluids, further research and proper validation is needed in order for them to be useful in the clinical setting. In addition, innovative and more efficient means of nucleic acid profiling are needed to facilitate investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of {EV} function and to establish their potential as useful clinical biomarkers and therapeutic tools. In this article, we provide an overview of recent technological improvements in both upstream {EV} isolation and downstream analytical technologies, including digital {PCR} and next generation sequencing, highlighting future prospects for {EV}-based molecular diagnostics.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach for the sensitive detection and accurate quantitation of messenger ribonucleic acid ({mRNA}) gene transcripts in single cells. First, the entire population of {mRNAs} is encoded with molecular barcodes during reverse transcription. After amplification of the gene targets of interest, molecular barcodes are counted by sequencing or scored on a simple hybridization detector to reveal the number of molecules in the starting sample. Since absolute quantities are measured, calibration to standards is unnecessary, and many of the relative quantitation challenges such as polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) bias are avoided. We apply the method to gene expression analysis of minute sample quantities and demonstrate precise measurements with sensitivity down to sub single-cell levels. The method is an easy, single-tube, end point assay utilizing standard thermal cyclers and {PCR} reagents. Accurate and precise measurements are obtained without any need for cycle-to-cycle intensity-based real-time monitoring or physical partitioning into multiple reactions (e.g., digital {PCR}). Further, since all {mRNA} molecules are encoded with molecular barcodes, amplification can be used to generate more material for multiple measurements and technical replicates can be carried out on limited samples. The method is particularly useful for small sample quantities, such as single-cell experiments. Digital encoding of cellular content preserves true abundance levels and overcomes distortions introduced by amplification.},

	abstract = {Brain metastases are associated with high morbidity as well as with poor prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Despite its clinical importance, metastasis of breast cancer cells through the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to investigate whether cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) play crucial roles in breast cancer brain metastasis. Using a cell adhesion assays, in vitro {BBB} permeability and transmigration assays, and soft agar colony formation assays, we investigated the physical roles of {CAFs} in breast cancer brain metastasis. We also performed immunofluorescence, flow cytometric analysis, Droplet Digital {PCR}, and Simon({TM}) Simple Western System to confirm changes in expression levels. We established two novel three-dimensional (3-D) culture systems using a perpendicular slide chamber and applying 3-D embedded culture method to reflect brain metastasis conditions. With a newly developed device, {CAFs} was proven to promote cell adhesion to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, in vitro {BBB} permeability and transmigration, and colony formation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, {CAFs} enhanced the invasive migration of breast cancer cells in two kinds of 3-D cultures. These 3-D models also reliably recapitulate the initial steps of {BBB} transmigration, micro-metastasis, and colonization. Expression of integrin α5β1 and αvβ3, c-{MET}, and α2,6-siayltransferase was increased in breast cancer cells that migrated through the {BBB}. In conclusion, based on our in vitro {BBB} and co-culture models, our data suggest that {CAFs} may play a role in breast cancer brain metastasis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2482},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Tumor genotyping using cell-free plasma {DNA} ({cfDNA}) has the potential to allow noninvasive assessment of tumor biology, yet many existing assays are cumbersome and vulnerable to false-positive results. We sought to determine whether droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) of {cfDNA} would allow highly specific and quantitative assessment of tumor genotype.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {ddPCR} assays for {EGFR}, {KRAS}, and {BRAF} mutations were developed using plasma collected from patients with advanced lung cancer or melanoma of a known tumor genotype. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using cancers with nonoverlapping genotypes as positive and negative controls. Serial assessment of response and resistance was studied in patients with {EGFR}-mutant lung cancer on a prospective trial of erlotinib.
{RESULTS}: We identified a reference range for {EGFR} L858R and exon 19 deletions in specimens from {KRAS}-mutant lung cancer, allowing identification of candidate thresholds with high sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Received operative characteristic curve analysis of four assays demonstrated an area under the curve in the range of 0.80 to 0.94. Sensitivity improved in specimens with optimal {cfDNA} concentrations. Serial plasma genotyping of {EGFR}-mutant lung cancer on erlotinib demonstrated pretreatment detection of {EGFR} mutations, complete plasma response in most cases, and increasing levels of {EGFR} T790M emerging before objective progression.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Noninvasive genotyping of {cfDNA} using {ddPCR} demonstrates assay qualities that could allow effective translation into a clinical diagnostic. Serial quantification of plasma genotype allows noninvasive assessment of response and resistance, including detection of resistance mutations up to 16 weeks before radiographic progression.

We compared protocols using a separate lysis buffer with cell capture directly in {RT}-{PA} reagent. The two methods were found to have similar lysis efficiencies whilst the direct {RT}-{PA} approach showed improved precision. Digital {PCR} was used to relate pre-amplified template copy numbers to Cq values and revealed where low quality signals may impact upon the analysis. We investigated the impact of calibration and data normalisation strategies as a means of minimising the impact of inter-experimental variation on gene expression values and found that both approaches can improve data comparability.

	abstract = {In this study, we present a highly customizable method for quantifying copy number and point mutations utilizing a single-color, droplet digital {PCR} platform. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ({ddPCR}) is rapidly replacing real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) as an efficient method of independent {DNA} quantification. Compared to quantative {PCR}, {ddPCR} eliminates the needs for traditional standards; instead, it measures target and reference {DNA} within the same well. The applications for {ddPCR} are widespread including targeted quantitation of genetic aberrations, which is commonly achieved with a two-color fluorescent oligonucleotide probe ({TaqMan}) design. However, the overall cost and need for optimization can be greatly reduced with an alternative method of distinguishing between target and reference products using the nonspecific {DNA} binding properties of {EvaGreen} ({EG}) dye. By manipulating the length of the target and reference amplicons, we can distinguish between their fluorescent signals and quantify each independently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by examining copy number in the proto-oncogene {FLT}3 and the common V600E point mutation in {BRAF}. Using a series of well-characterized control samples and cancer cell lines, we confirmed the accuracy of our method in quantifying mutation percentage and integer value copy number changes. As another novel feature, our assay was able to detect a mutation comprising less than 1\% of an otherwise wild-type sample, as well as copy number changes from cancers even in the context of significant dilution with normal {DNA}. This flexible and cost-effective method of independent {DNA} quantification proves to be a robust alternative to the commercialized {TaqMan} assay.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Human herpesvirus 6 ({HHV}-6) latently infects a majority of adults. In about 1\% of the population {HHV}-6 exists in a chromosomally integrated form ({ciHHV}-6) that resides in every somatic and germ cell and can be transmitted through the germ line. Patients with {ciHHV}-6 have been misdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated for active {HHV}-6 infection, sometimes with important side effects, based on results from quantitative molecular {HHV}-6 tests.{METHODS}: A droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) assay was developed to identify {ciHHV}-6 in cellular patient samples by precisely determining the ratio of {HHV}-6 to cellular {DNA}. We validated the assay on confirmed {ciHHV}-6 patient samples and a cell line derived from a {ciHHV}-6 patient, and we analyzed hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients suspected of having {ciHHV}-6. We additionally evaluated whether the assay could be applied to stored plasma samples from a study of clinical correlates of {HHV}-6.{RESULTS}: The {ddPCR} assay accurately identified {ciHHV}-6 in cellular samples (buffy coat, peripheral blood mononuclear cells), giving a ratio very close to 1 {HHV}-6/cell [mean ({SD}), 1.02 (0.03)] in fluorescence in situ hybridization-confirmed samples). In stored plasma samples, the assay performance was set by design to have 100\% sensitivity, which resulted in 82\% specificity for {ciHHV}-6.{CONCLUSIONS}: The possibility of {ciHHV}-6 is often overlooked in patients with detectable {HHV}-6 viral loads by quantitative {PCR}. Our {ddPCR} test provides rapid and accurate laboratory identification of {ciHHV}-6 from easily obtained cellular samples. In addition, the assay provides excellent sensitivity and specificity using stored plasma samples, facilitating retrospective analysis of the clinical significance of {ciHHV}-6.},

Alternative {qPCR}, gel-based, or Southern blotting titering methods have been designed to overcome these issues but may represent a backward step from standard {qPCR} methods in terms of simplicity, robustness, and precision. Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) is a new {PCR} technique that directly quantifies {DNA} copies with an unparalleled degree of precision and without the need for a standard curve or for a high degree of amplification efficiency; all properties that lend themselves to the accurate quantification of both single-stranded and self-complementary {AAV} genomes. Here we compare a {ddPCR}-based {AAV} genome titer assay with a standard and an optimized {qPCR} assay for the titration of both single-stranded and self-complementary {AAV} genomes. We demonstrate absolute quantification of single-stranded {AAV} vector genomes by {ddPCR} with up to 4-fold increases in titer over a standard {qPCR} titration but with equivalent readout to an optimized {qPCR} assay. In the case of self-complementary vectors, {ddPCR} titers were on average 5-, 1.9-, and 2.3-fold higher than those determined by standard {qPCR}, optimized {qPCR}, and agarose gel assays, respectively. Droplet digital {PCR}-based genome titering was superior to {qPCR} in terms of both intra- and interassay precision and is more resistant to {PCR} inhibitors, a desirable feature for in-process monitoring of early-stage vector production and for vector genome biodistribution analysis in inhibitory tissues.},

Using 3D, we interrogated over 8 billion mitochondrial genomes to analyze the age-related dynamics of {mtDNA} deletions in human brain tissue.

Quantification of {amoA} genes in ammonia oxidizing bacteria ({AOB}) and archaea ({AOA}), and of {nirS} and {nosZ} genes in the denitrifiers is very important for determining their distribution and abundance in the natural environment. A plasmid reference material containing {nirS}, {nosZ}, {amoA}-{AOB}, and {amoA}-{AOA} is developed to provide a {DNA} standard with copy number concentration for ensuring comparability and reliability of quantification of these genes. Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) was evaluated for characterization of the plasmid reference material. The result revealed that restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmids can improve amplification efficiency and minimize the measurement bias of {ddPCR}. Compared with the conformation of the plasmid, the size of the {DNA} fragment containing the target sequence and the location of the restriction site relative to the target sequence are not significant factors affecting plasmid quantification by {ddPCR}. Liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{IDMS}) was used to provide independent data for quantifying the plasmid reference material. The copy number concentration of the digested plasmid determined by {ddPCR} agreed well with that determined by {LC}-{IDMS}, improving both the accuracy and reliability of the plasmid reference material. The reference value, with its expanded uncertainty (k = 2), of the plasmid reference material was determined to be (5.19 ± 0.41) × 10(9) copies μL(-1) by averaging the results of two independent measurements. Consideration of the factors revealed in this study can improve the reliability and accuracy of {ddPCR}; thus, this method has the potential to accurately quantify {DNA} reference materials.},

	abstract = {Cell-associated ({CA}) {HIV}-1 {RNA} is considered a potential marker for assessment of viral reservoir dynamics and antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) response in {HIV}-infected patients. Recent studies employed sensitive seminested real-time quantitative (q){PCR} to quantify {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA}. Digital {PCR} has been recently described as an alternative {PCR}-based technique for absolute quantification with higher accuracy compared to {qPCR}. Here, a comparison was made between the droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and the seminested {qPCR} for quantification of unspliced (us) and multiply spliced (ms) {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA}. Synthetic {RNA} standards and {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA} from infected patients on and off {ART} (N = 34) were quantified with both methods. Correlations were observed between the methods both for serially diluted synthetic standards ({usRNA}: R(2) = 0.97, {msRNA}: R(2) = 0.92) and patient-derived samples ({usRNA}: R(2) = 0.51, {msRNA}: R(2) = 0.87). Seminested {qPCR} showed better quantitative linearity, accuracy and sensitivity in the quantification of synthetic standards than {ddPCR}, especially in the lower quantification ranges. Both methods demonstrated equally high detection rate of {usRNA} in patient samples on and off {ART} (91\%), whereas {ddPCR} detected {msRNA} in larger proportion of samples from {ART}-treated patients (p = 0.13). We observed an average agreement between the methods for {usRNA} quantification in patient samples, albeit with a large standard deviation (bias = 0.05±0.75 log10). However, a bias of 0.94±0.36 log10 was observed for {msRNA}. No-template controls were consistently negative in the seminested {qPCR}, but yielded a positive {ddPCR} signal for some wells. Therefore, the false positive signals may have affected the detection power of {ddPCR} in this study. Digital {PCR} is promising for {HIV} nucleic acid quantification, but the false positive signals need further attention. Quantitative assays for {CA} {HIV} {RNA} have the potential to improve monitoring of patients on {ART} and to be used in clinical studies aimed at {HIV} eradication, but should be cross-validated by multiple laboratories prior to wider use.},

The main scope of this work was the transcriptome profiling of genes on human chromosome 18 (Chr 18), as well as their encoded proteome, from three types of biomaterials: liver tissue, the hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line {HepG}2, and blood plasma. The transcriptome profiling for liver tissue was independently performed using two {RNaseq} platforms ({SOLiD} and Illumina) and also by droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and quantitative {RT}-{PCR}. The proteome profiling of Chr 18 was accomplished by quantitatively measuring protein copy numbers in the three types of biomaterial (the lowest protein concentration measured was 10(-13) M) using selected reaction monitoring ({SRM}). In total, protein copy numbers were estimated for 228 master proteins, including quantitative data on 164 proteins in plasma, 171 in the {HepG}2 cell line, and 186 in liver tissue. Most proteins were present in plasma at 10(8) copies/μL, while the median abundance was 10(4) and 10(5) protein copies per cell in {HepG}2 cells and liver tissue, respectively. In summary, for liver tissue and {HepG}2 cells a "transcriptoproteome" was produced that reflects the relationship between transcript and protein copy numbers of the genes on Chr 18. The quantitative data acquired by {RNaseq}, {PCR}, and {SRM} were uploaded into the "Update\_2013" data set of our knowledgebase (www.kb18.ru) and investigated for linear correlations.},

Measuring {miRNA} expression levels in sputum could provide a potential approach for the diagnosis of lung cancer. The emerging digital {PCR} is a straightforward technique for precise, direct, and absolute quantification of nucleic acids. The objective of the study was to investigate whether digital {PCR} could be used to quantify {miRNAs} in sputum for lung cancer diagnosis.
{METHODS}: We first determined and compared dynamic ranges of digital {PCR} and conventional quantitative reverse transcriptase {PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) for {miRNA} quantification using {RNA} isolated from sputum of five healthy individuals. We then used digital {PCR} to quantify copy number of two lung cancer-associated {miRNAs} ({miR}-31 and {miR}-210) in 35 lung cancer patients and 40 cancer-free controls.
{RESULTS}: Copy number of the {miRNAs} measured by digital {PCR} displayed a linear response to input {cDNA} amount in a twofold dilution series over seven orders of magnitude. {miRNA} quantification determined by digital {PCR} assay was in good agreement with that obtained from {qRT}-{PCR} analysis in sputum. Furthermore, combined quantification of {miR}-31 and {miR}-210 copy number by using digital {PCR} in sputum of the cases and controls provided 65.71 \% sensitivity and 85.00 \% specificity for lung cancer diagnosis.

	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2013.206359},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Multiplex digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) enables noninvasive and sensitive detection of circulating tumor {DNA} with performance unachievable by current molecular-detection approaches. Furthermore, picodroplet {dPCR} facilitates simultaneous screening for multiple mutations from the same sample.
{METHODS}: We investigated the utility of multiplex {dPCR} to screen for the 7 most common mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the {KRAS} (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) oncogene from plasma samples of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Fifty plasma samples were tested from patients for whom the primary tumor biopsy tissue {DNA} had been characterized by quantitative {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: Tumor characterization revealed that 19 patient tumors had {KRAS} mutations. Multiplex {dPCR} analysis of the plasma {DNA} prepared from these samples identified 14 samples that matched the mutation identified in the tumor, 1 sample contained a different {KRAS} mutation, and 4 samples had no detectable mutation. Among the tumor samples that were wild type for {KRAS}, 2 {KRAS} mutations were identified in the corresponding plasma samples. Duplex {dPCR} (i.e., wild-type and single-mutation assay) was also used to analyze plasma samples from patients with {KRAS}-mutated tumors and 5 samples expected to contain the {BRAF} (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) V600E mutation. The results for the duplex analysis matched those for the multiplex analysis for {KRAS}-mutated samples and, owing to its higher sensitivity, enabled detection of 2 additional samples with low levels of {KRAS}-mutated {DNA}. All 5 samples with {BRAF} mutations were detected.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This work demonstrates the clinical utility of multiplex {dPCR} to screen for multiple mutations simultaneously with a sensitivity sufficient to detect mutations in circulating {DNA} obtained by noninvasive blood collection.},

The evaluation of gene copy numbers by a {qPCR} method, is one of the most common approaches used to assess the consistency of transgenes in a constructed cell line. The cell line {AV}529-19 is a Vero-based cell line specifically engineered to express the {HSV}-1 {UL}5 and {UL}29 open reading frames. {AV}529-19 is used to support the replication of a defective {HSV}-2 viral candidate vaccine called {HSV}529. To assess the genetic stability of the {UL}5 and {UL}29 transgenes in {AV}529-19 cells, a digital {PCR}-based approach was developed. During characterization of the test method, the specificity, accuracy, and intermediate precision of the assay was investigated based on regulatory guidelines. The developed assay was used to monitor the stability of the transgenes in the manufactured {AV}529-19 cell lines by comparison of transgene copy numbers in the master cell bank ({MCB}) with their copy numbers in the extended cell bank ({ECB}). Results showed that the {UL}29 and {UL}5 transgenes are stable in that there are one and three copies of the {UL}29 and {UL}5 genes, respectively, per cell in both the {AV}529-19 {MCB} and {ECB}.},

	abstract = {The genus Parapoxvirus ({PAPV}) is comprised traditionally of orf virus ({ORFV}), pseudocowpox virus ({PCPV}) and bovine papular stomatitis virus ({BPSV}), which cause infections of ruminants and their handlers in the U.S. and worldwide. Unlike orthopoxvirus infections, which can cause systemic or localized infections, {PAPV} infections present normally as benign, self-limited and localized skin lesions; infections do not confer lifelong immunity. In recent years, related potentially to enhanced awareness and the availability of diagnostic methods, there has been an observed increase in reported cases of {PAPV} in animals and humans. This study describes {TaqMan} based real-time {PCR} assays for both generic and specific detection of {PAPV} species for surveillance and outbreak investigations. These assays target highly conserved {PAPV} {RNA} polymerase gene sequences and are capable of detecting three known species of {PAPVs} ({ORFV}, {PCPV}, and {BPSV}). The assays were evaluated using a panel of {PAPV} {DNA} derived from human infections or animal specimen remainders. The sensitivities of all four assays were determined using droplet digital {PCR}; fewer than 10 copies of clinical {PAPV} {DNA} can be detected consistently. These assays provide a reliable and sensitive method for rapid confirmation and characterization {PAPV} infections with varying clinical presentations.},

Currently, there is no program to eliminate blinding trachoma as a public health problem. We need better diagnostic tests for research and to assess progress in control programs. Roberts et al. adapted droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}), an emulsion {PCR} process that performs absolute quantitation of nucleic acids, to detect and quantify Chlamydia trachomatis infections. They compared the results with {ddPCR} on conjunctival swab specimens collected in trachoma-endemic area to results using Roche's Amplicor® C. trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae ({CT}/{NG}) {PCR} and found that {ddPCR} sensitivity was 73.3\%. The authors concluded that '{ddPCR} is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections'. This reviewer disagrees, feeling that if the stated sensitivity is accurate, it is too low, and suggests there may be good reasons to adapt commercially available tests for this purpose.},

With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma {DNA}, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To study the ability of a stabilizing reagent to prevent cellular {DNA} contamination of cell-free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) in plasma during whole blood sample storage and shipping.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Samples were drawn from healthy donors into K₃{EDTA} and Cell-Free {DNA} {BCTs} ({BCT}) and stored at room temperature ({RT}). Aliquots were removed at specified time points and {cfDNA} was purified from the plasma. A Droplet Digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) assay that amplifies a short β-actin gene fragment (136 bp) was used to measure the total plasma {cfDNA} ({pDNA}) concentration while a longer β-actin fragment (420 bp) was used to quantify genomic {DNA} ({gDNA}). In a follow-up experiment, blood samples drawn into the same types of tubes were shipped round trip by overnight air before {cfDNA} was isolated and analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Blood stored in K₃{EDTA} tubes at {RT} showed increases in {pDNA} and {gDNA} concentrations over time. However, both {pDNA} and {gDNA} levels remained stable in {BCT} for at least seven days. On day 14, there was a 4.5-fold increase in {pDNA} in {BCT} as compared to {\textgreater}200-fold increase in K₃{EDTA} tubes. Likewise, {gDNA} increased {\textless}2-fold on day 14 in {BCT} as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K₃{EDTA} tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cell-Free {DNA} {BCTs} prevent {gDNA} contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable {cfDNA} samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of {gDNA} contamination.},

Thus far, {EGFR} mutation analysis has not been systematically demonstrated for sputum samples. The aim of the present study was to determine whether {EGFR} mutation analysis is attainable on sputum samples, employing different assays in a multicenter study.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Sputum {DNA} from 10 lung cancer patients with confirmed {EGFR} mutation in their tumour tissue, 10 lung cancer patients without evidence of an {EGFR} mutation, and 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) was used for mutation analysis by Cycleave {PCR}, {COLD}-{PCR}, {PangaeaBiotech} {SL} Technology ({PST}), and High Resolution Melting, respectively. Targeted resequencing ({TruSeq} Amplicon Cancer Panel) and droplet digital {PCR} were additionally performed on the 10 samples with {EGFR} mutation.
{RESULTS}: Dependent on the assay, {EGFR} mutations could be detected in 30-50\% of the sputum samples of patients with {EGFR} mutations. The different techniques revealed consistent results, with slightly higher sensitivity for {PST}. Neither the lung cancer patients without {EGFR} mutation nor the {COPD} controls tested positive for {EGFR} mutations in their sputum samples, indicating high clinical specificity of all assays.

Universal digital high-resolution melt (U-{dHRM}) is a new approach to broad-based {PCR} diagnostics and profiling technologies that can overcome issues of poor sensitivity due to contaminating nucleic acids and poor specificity due to primer or probe hybridization inaccuracies for single nucleotide variations. The U-{dHRM} approach uses broad-based primers or ligated adapter sequences to universally amplify all nucleic acid molecules in a heterogeneous sample, which have been partitioned, as in digital {PCR}. Extensive assay optimization enables direct sequence identification by algorithm-based matching of melt curve shape and Tm to a database of known sequence-specific melt curves. We show that single-molecule detection and single nucleotide sensitivity is possible. The feasibility and utility of U-{dHRM} is demonstrated through detection of bacteria associated with polymicrobial blood infection and {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) associated with host response to infection. U-{dHRM} using broad-based 16S {rRNA} gene primers demonstrates universal single cell detection of bacterial pathogens, even in the presence of larger amounts of contaminating bacteria; U-{dHRM} using universally adapted Lethal-7 {miRNAs} in a heterogeneous mixture showcases the single copy sensitivity and single nucleotide specificity of this approach.},

We use this technique in our healthy study population to determine the overall concentration of the t(14;18) translocation, which is strongly associated with follicular lymphoma. The nested {dPCR} approach improves the detection limit to 1×10(-7) or lower while maintaining the analysis efficiency and specificity. Further, the bead-based {dPCR} enabled us to isolate and quantify the relative amounts of the various clonal forms of t(14;18) translocation in these subjects, and the single-molecule sensitivity and resolution of {dPCR} led to the discovery of new clonal forms of t(14;18) that were otherwise masked by the conventional quantitative {PCR} measurements. In this manner, we created a quantitative map for this carcinogenic mutation in this healthy population and identified the positions on chromosomes 14 and 18 where the vast majority of these t(14;18) events occur.},

In this study, two extraction methods using similar chemistries but different workflows were compared for isolation efficiency and percent fetal {DNA} recovery. The Akonni Biosystems {TruTip} technology uses a binding matrix embedded in a pipette tip; the Circulating Nucleic Acids Kit from Qiagen employs a spin column approach. The {TruTip} method adds an extra step to decrease the recovery of {DNA} fragments larger than 600 bp from the sample to yield an overall higher percentage of smaller molecular weight {DNA}, effectively enriching for fetal {DNA}. In this evaluation, three separate extraction comparison studies were performed--a dilution series of fragmented {DNA} in plasma, a set of clinical maternal samples, and a blood collection tube time point study of maternal samples. Both extraction methods were found to efficiently extract small fragment {DNA} from large volumes of plasma. In the amended samples, the {TruTip} extraction method was {\textasciitilde}15\% less efficient with overall {DNA} recovery, but yielded an 87\% increase in \% fetal {DNA} relative to the Qiagen method. The average percent increase of fetal {DNA} of {TruTip} extracted samples compared to the Qiagen method was 55\% for all sets of blinded clinical samples. A study comparing extraction efficiencies from whole blood samples incubated up to 48 hours prior to processing into plasma resulted in more consistent \% fetal {DNA} recoveries using {TruTip}. The extracted products were tested on two detection platforms, quantitative real-time {PCR} and droplet digital {PCR}, and yielded similar results for both extraction methods.},

	abstract = {Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) is an emulsion {PCR} process that performs absolute quantitation of nucleic acids. We developed a {ddPCR} assay for Chlamydia trachomatis infections and found it to be accurate and precise. Using {PCR} mixtures containing plasmids engineered to include the {PCR} target sequences, we were able to quantify with a dynamic range between 0.07 and 3,160 targets/μl (r(2) = 0.9927) with {\textgreater}95\% confidence. Using 1,509 clinical conjunctival swab samples from a population in which trachoma is endemic in Guinea Bissau, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the quantitative {ddPCR} assay in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections by comparing the performances of {ddPCR} and the Roche Amplicor {CT}/{NG} test. We defined {ddPCR} tests as positive when we had ≥95\% confidence in a nonzero estimate of target load. The sensitivity of {ddPCR} against Amplicor was 73.3\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 67.9 to 78.7\%), and specificity was 99.1\% (95\% {CI}, 98.6 to 99.6\%). Negative and positive predictive values were 94.6\% (95\% {CI}, 93.4 to 95.8\%) and 94.5\% (95\% {CI}, 91.3 to 97.7\%), respectively. Based on Amplicor {CT}/{NG} testing, the estimated population prevalence of C. trachomatis ocular infection was ∼17.5\%. Receiver-operator curve analysis was used to select critical cutoff values for use in clinical settings in which a balance between higher sensitivity and specificity is required. We concluded that {ddPCR} is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections.},

Reference cultures of {MRSA}, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ({MSSA}), and confounders were included as controls.

Swab extraction and cell lysis were accomplished using magnetic-driven agitation of silica beads. Quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) (Roche Light Cycler 480) and {ddPCR} (Bio-Rad {QX}100 droplet digital {PCR} system) assays were used to detect genes for the staphylococcal protein {SA}0140 ({SA}) and the methicillin resistance ({mecA}) gene employing standard {TaqMan} chemistries.

We adapted digital {PCR} to determine the presence of oncogenic amplification through noninvasive analysis of circulating free plasma {DNA} and exemplify this approach by developing a plasma {DNA} digital {PCR} assay for {HER}2 copy number.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: The reference gene for copy number assessment was assessed experimentally and bioinformatically. Chromosome 17 pericentromeric probes were shown to be suboptimal, and {EFTUD}2 at chromosome position 17q21.31 was selected for analysis. Digital {PCR} assay parameters were determined on plasma samples from a development cohort of 65 patients and assessed in an independent validation cohort of plasma samples from 58 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The sequential probability ratio test was used to assign the plasma {DNA} digital {PCR} test as being {HER}2-positive or -negative in the validation cohort.
{RESULTS}: In the development cohort, the {HER}2:{EFTUD}2 plasma {DNA} copy number ratio had a receiver operator area under the curve ({AUC}) = 0.92 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.86-0.99, P = 0.0003]. In the independent validation cohort, 64\% (7 of 11) of patients with {HER}2-amplified cancers were classified as plasma digital {PCR} {HER}2-positive and 94\% (44 of 47) of patients with {HER}2-nonamplified cancers were classified as digital {PCR} {HER}2-negative, with a positive and negative predictive value of 70\% and 92\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: Analysis of plasma {DNA} with digital {PCR} has the potential to screen for the acquisition of {HER}2 amplification in metastatic breast cancer. This approach could potentially be adapted to the analysis of any locus amplified in cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2) testing is routinely performed by immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}) analyses for all new cases of invasive breast carcinoma. {IHC} is easier to perform, but analysis can be subjective and variable. {FISH} offers better diagnostic accuracy and added confidence, particularly when it is used to supplement weak {IHC} signals, but it is more labor intensive and costly than {IHC}. We examined the performance of droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) as a more precise and less subjective alternative for quantifying {HER}2 {DNA} amplification.
{METHODS}: Thirty-nine cases of invasive breast carcinoma containing ≥30\% tumor were classified as positive or negative for {HER}2 by {IHC}, {FISH}, or both. {DNA} templates for these cases were prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) tissues to determine the {HER}2 copy number by {ddPCR}. {ddPCR} involved emulsifying hydrolysis probe-based {PCR} reaction mixtures containing the {ERBB}2 [v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian); also known as {HER}2] gene and chromosome 17 centromere assays into nanoliter-sized droplets for thermal cycling and analysis.
{RESULTS}: {ddPCR} distinguished, through differences in the level of {HER}2 amplification, the 10 {HER}2-positive samples from the 29 {HER}2-negative samples with 100\% concordance to {HER}2 status obtained by {FISH} and {IHC} analysis. {ddPCR} results agreed with the {FISH} results for the 6 cases that were equivocal by {IHC} analyses, confirming 2 of these samples as positive for {HER}2 and the other 4 as negative.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}) is currently used for quantitative molecular analysis of the presence of {GMOs} in products. However, its use is limited for detecting and quantifying very small numbers of {DNA} targets, as in some complex food and feed matrices. Using {ddPCR} duplex assay, we have measured the absolute numbers of {MON}810 transgene and hmg maize reference gene copies in {DNA} samples. Key performance parameters of the assay were determined. The {ddPCR} system is shown to offer precise absolute and relative quantification of targets, without the need for calibration curves. The sensitivity (five target {DNA} copies) of the {ddPCR} assay compares well with those of individual {qPCR} assays and of the chamber digital {PCR} ({cdPCR}) approach. It offers a dynamic range over four orders of magnitude, greater than that of {cdPCR}. Moreover, when compared to {qPCR}, the {ddPCR} assay showed better repeatability at low target concentrations and a greater tolerance to inhibitors. Finally, {ddPCR} throughput and cost are advantageous relative to those of {qPCR} for routine {GMO} quantification.

We describe a picoliter droplet-based digital {PCR} method that enables simultaneous detection of {DNA} integrity and the quantity of amplifiable {DNA}.
{METHODS}: Using a multiplex assay, we detected 4 different target lengths (78, 159, 197, and 550 bp). Assays were validated with human genomic {DNA} fragmented to sizes of 170 bp to 3000 bp. The technique was validated with {DNA} quantities as low as 1 ng. We evaluated 12 {DNA} samples extracted from paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma tissues.
{RESULTS}: One sample contained no amplifiable {DNA}. The fractions of amplifiable {DNA} for the 11 other samples were between 0.05\% and 10.1\% for 78-bp fragments and ≤1\% for longer fragments. Four samples were chosen for enrichment and next-generation sequencing. The quality of the sequencing data was in agreement with the results of the {DNA}-integrity test. Specifically, {DNA} with low integrity yielded sequencing results with lower levels of coverage and uniformity and had higher levels of false-positive variants.

	abstract = {Quantitative real-time {PCR} ({QRT}-{PCR}) has been widely implemented for clinical viral load testing, but a lack of standardization and relatively poor precision have hindered its usefulness. Digital {PCR} offers highly precise, direct quantification without requiring a calibration curve. Performance characteristics of real-time {PCR} were compared to those of droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) for cytomegalovirus ({CMV}) load testing. Tenfold serial dilutions of the World Health Organization ({WHO}) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) {CMV} quantitative standards were tested, together with the {AcroMetrix} {CMV} tc panel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, {CA}) and 50 human plasma specimens. Each method was evaluated using all three standards for quantitative linearity, lower limit of detection ({LOD}), and accuracy. Quantitative correlation, mean viral load, and variability were compared. Real-time {PCR} showed somewhat higher sensitivity than {ddPCR} ({LODs}, 3 log(10) versus 4 log(10) copies/ml and {IU}/ml for {NIST} and {WHO} standards, respectively). Both methods showed a high degree of linearity and quantitative correlation for standards (R(2) ≥ 0.98 in each of 6 regression models) and clinical samples (R(2) = 0.93) across their detectable ranges. For higher concentrations, {ddPCR} showed less variability than {QRT}-{PCR} for the {WHO} standards and {AcroMetrix} standards (P {\textless} 0.05). {QRT}-{PCR} showed less variability and greater sensitivity than did {ddPCR} in clinical samples. Both digital and real-time {PCR} provide accurate {CMV} load data over a wide linear dynamic range. Digital {PCR} may provide an opportunity to reduce the quantitative variability currently seen using real-time {PCR}, but methods need to be further optimized to match the sensitivity of real-time {PCR}.},

In contrast to valve-actuated devices that only modulate the flow of the dispersed phase being continuously injected, this integrated micropump allows the combination of fluidic transport and modulation to achieve active control of droplet generation. A distinct characteristic of this method compared to the valve modulated droplet formation processes is that it enables independent control of droplet generation frequency by adjusting the pumping frequency and droplet size by flow conditions. We also demonstrated the generation of complex droplet patterns through programming the pumping configurations and the application to multi-volume digital {PCR} for precise and quantitative detection of genetic targets. Overall, our results suggest that the pump-based droplet microfluidics provide a robust platform for programmable active droplet generation which could facilitate the development of high-performance chemical and biological assays.},

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of digital {PCR} for quantification of plasma {miRNAs} and the potential utility of this technique for cancer diagnosis. We used digital {PCR} to quantify the copy number of plasma {microRNA}-21-5p ({miR}-21-5p) and {microRNA}-335-3p ({miR}-335-3p) in 36 lung cancer patients and 38 controls. Digital {PCR} showed a high degree of linearity and quantitative correlation with {miRNAs} in a dynamic range from 1 to 10,000 copies/μL of input, with high reproducibility. {qPCR} exhibited a dynamic range from 100 to 1×10(7) copies/μL of input. Digital {PCR} had a higher sensitivity to detect copy number of the {miRNAs} compared with {qPCR}. In plasma, digital {PCR} could detect copy number of both {miR}-21-5p and {miR}-335-3p, whereas {qPCR} was only able to assess {miR}-21-5p.

Here, we describe a digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) approach that can be used to accurately measure the novel reference plasmid {pKefeng}6 and quantify the unauthorized variety of {GM} rice Kefeng6, eliminating the issues associated with matrix effects in calibration curves. The {pKefeng}6 plasmid was used as a calibrant for the quantification of Kefeng6 rice by determining the copy numbers of event- (77 bp) and taxon-specific (68 bp) fragments, their ratios, and their concentrations. The plasmid was diluted to five different concentrations. The third sample (S3) was optimized for the quantification range of {dPCR} according to previous reports. The ratio between the two fragments was 1.005, which closely approximated the value certified by sequencing, and the concentration was found to be 792 copies/μL. This method was precise, with an {RSD} of {\textasciitilde}3\%. These findings demonstrate the advantages of using the {dPCR} method to characterize reference materials.},

	abstract = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2, also known as {erbB}2) gene is involved in signal transduction for cell growth and differentiation. It is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and a proto-oncogene. Overexpression of {HER}2 is of clinical relevance in breast cancer due to its prognostic value correlating elevated expression with worsening clinical outcome. At the same time, {HER}2 assessment is also of importance because successful anti-tumor treatment with Herceptin® is strongly correlated with {HER}2 overexpression in the tumor (approximately 30\% of all breast tumors overexpress {HER}2). In a comprehensive national study, Wolff et al. [1] state that "Approximately 20\% of current {HER}2 testing may be inaccurate" which underscores the importance of developing more accurate methods to determine {HER}2 status. Droplet Digital™ {PCR} ({ddPCR}™) has the potential to improve upon {HER}2 measurements due to its ability to quantitate {DNA} and {RNA} targets with high precision and accuracy. Here we present a study which investigates whether {ddPCR} can be used to assess {HER}2 transcript levels in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) human breast tumors and whether these {ddPCR} measurements agree with prior assessments of these same samples by pathologists using immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) and in some cases fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}). We also determined the copy number of {HER}2 in these samples as compared to the {CEP}17 reference gene. Results: Clinical {FFPE} samples were successfully studied using {ddPCR} and compared to results from standard {FISH} and {IHC} methodology. The results demonstrate that {ddPCR} can rank order the samples in complete agreement with the current standard methods and that {ddPCR} has the added benefit of providing quantitative results, rather than relying on the expert skill of a seasoned pathologist for determination.},

Copy number and structural aberrations were validated using droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}). Using mate-pair sequencing chromosomal aneuploidies were found in two tumors, frequent smaller deletions were found in one, inter-chromosomal fusions in one other, whereas one tumor was almost normal. These aberrations affect several known cancer associated genes such as {cMYC}, and {KIT}. One common deletion of the proximal end of {CFA}27, harboring the tumor suppressor gene {PFDN}5 was detected in four tumors.

This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of {ddPCR} to measure the frequency of total {HIV} {DNA} (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-{LTR} (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by {ddPCR} and by real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-{LTR} circles. Additional benefits of the {ddPCR} assay over {qPCR} include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital {PCR} an attractive alternative for measurement of {HIV} {DNA} in clinical specimens.

	abstract = {Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format {dPCR} can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on {dPCR} analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic {DNA}) on measurement precision using {dPCR}. We were able to demonstrate that duplex {dPCR} can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex {dPCR}, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of {dPCR}. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of {dPCR} imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by {dPCR} at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid {DNA} is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic {DNA}.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents an enormous public health threat. It is typically defined as {\textgreater}1\% of drug resistant colonies using the agar proportion method. Detecting small numbers of drug resistant Tb in a population, also known as heteroresistance, is challenging with current methodologies. Here we have utilized digital {PCR} to detect heteroresistance within M. tuberculosis populations with excellent accuracy versus the agar proportion method. We designed dual {TaqMan}-{MGB} probes to detect wild-type and mutant sequences of {katG} (315), {rpoB} (531), {gyrA} (94,95) and rrs (1401), genes that associate with resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside respectively. We generated heteroresistant mixtures of susceptible and extensively drug resistant Tb, followed by {DNA} extraction and digital {PCR}. Digital {PCR} yielded a close approximation to agar proportion's percentages of resistant colonies, and yielded 100\% concordance with agar proportion's susceptible/resistant results. Indeed, the digital {PCR} method was able to identify mutant sequence in mixtures containing as little as 1000∶1 susceptible:resistant Tb. By contrast, real-time {PCR} or {PCR} followed by Sanger sequencing were less sensitive and had little resolution to detect heteroresistance, requiring fully 1∶1 or 10∶1 susceptible:resistant ratios in order to detect resistance. Our assay can also work in sputum so long as sufficient quantities of Tb are present ({\textgreater}1000 cfu/ml). This work demonstrates the utility of digital {PCR} to detect and quantify heteroresistance in drug resistant Tb, which may be useful to inform treatment decisions faster than agar proportion.},

The fact that circulating fetal {DNA} represents only a minor fraction of the {DNA} that is present in maternal plasma has presented analytical challenges for a number of applications. In this review, we discuss such challenges and how they have been resolved by recent developments in the field.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Digital molecular counting methods, such as digital {PCR} and massively parallel sequencing, have enabled high quantitative precision for maternal plasma {DNA} analysis. Noninvasive prenatal analysis of monogenic disease mutations has been achieved by identifying small quantitative differences between the mutant and wild-type alleles in maternal plasma. By measuring the small increment in the fractional concentrations of {DNA} derived from potentially aneuploid chromosomes in maternal plasma, fetal chromosomal aneuploidies have been detected with high diagnostic accuracies.
{SUMMARY}: Recently, advances in molecular technologies have enhanced the diagnostic applications of maternal plasma {DNA} analysis for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. We foresee that this technology could play an increasingly important role in prenatal investigations.},

{METHODS}: Small-size {DNA} (150-250 base pairs) was extracted from the plasma of 31 controls and 80 patients with glioma with known {IDH}1(R132H) status and correlated with {MRI} data. The {IDH}1(R132H) mutation was detected by a combination of coamplification at lower denaturation temperature and digital {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: The small size {DNA} concentration was 1.2 ng/{mL} (range 0.1-6.6) in controls vs 1.2 ng/{mL} (range 0.1-50.3) in patients with glioma (p = not significant) and 0.9 ng/{mL} (0.0-3.0) in low-grade gliomas vs 1.5 ng/{mL} in high-grade gliomas (p {\textless} 0.01). The small size {DNA} concentration correlated with enhancing tumor volume (1.6 ng/{mL} [0.4-24.9] when {\textless}10 cm(3) and 14.0 ng/{mL} [0.6-50.3] when ≥10 cm(3)). The {IDH}1(R132H) mutation was detected in 15 out of 25 plasma {DNA} mixtures (60\%) from patients with mutated tumors and in none of the 14 patients with a nonmutated tumor. The sensitivity increased with enhancing tumor volume (3/9 in nonenhancing tumors, 6/10 for enhancing volume {\textless}10 cm(3), and 6/6 for enhancing volume ≥10 cm(3)).
{CONCLUSION}: With a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity related to the tumor volume and contrast enhancement, {IDH}1(R132H) identification has a valuable diagnostic accuracy in patients not amenable to biopsy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A genomewide genetic and mutational profile of a fetus was recently determined via deep sequencing of maternal plasma {DNA}. This technology could have important applications for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis ({NIPD}) of many monogenic diseases. Relative haplotype dosage ({RHDO}) analysis, a core step of this procedure, would allow one to elucidate the maternally inherited half of the fetal genome. For clinical applications, the cost and complexity of data analysis might be reduced via targeted application of this approach to selected genomic regions containing disease-causing genes. There is thus a need to explore the feasibility of performing {RHDO} analysis in a targeted manner.
{METHODS}: We performed target enrichment by using solution-phase hybridization followed by massively parallel sequencing of the β-globin gene region in 2 families undergoing prenatal diagnosis for β-thalassemia. We used digital {PCR} strategies to physically deduce parental haplotypes. Finally, we performed {RHDO} analysis with target-enriched sequencing data and parental haplotypes to reveal the β-thalassemic status for the fetuses.
{RESULTS}: A mean sequencing depth of 206-fold was achieved in the β-globin gene region by targeted sequencing of maternal plasma {DNA}. {RHDO} analysis was successful for the sequencing data obtained from the target-enriched samples, including a region in one of the families in which the parents had similar haplotype structures. Data analysis revealed that both fetuses were heterozygous carriers of β-thalassemia.

We assessed the feasibility of a nanofluidic digital {PCR} array platform to detect and quantify {KRAS} mutations simultaneously in clinically relevant samples.
{METHODS}: We assessed 2 groups of patients (colorectal and pancreatic disease): Group 1 consisted of 27 patients with colorectal carcinomas, 14 patients with adenomas, and 5 control individuals; group 2 consisted of 42 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, 4 with adenocarcinomas of the ampulla, and 6 with chronic pancreatitis). Digital {PCR} was performed with the Digital Array Chip (Fluidigm).
{RESULTS}: Nanofluidic digital {PCR} detected mutant alleles at 0.05\% to 0.1\%, depending on the variant analyzed. For the colorectal disease group, conventional {PCR} detected 9 (64\%) of 14 adenomas that were positive for {KRAS} mutants, whereas digital {PCR} increased this number to 11 (79\%) of 14. Sixteen (59\%) of 27 carcinomas showed {KRAS} mutation with conventional {PCR}. Two additional cases were detected with digital {PCR}. In 5 cases (3 adenomas, 2 carcinomas), the total number of mutant alleles changed. For the pancreatic disease group, digital {PCR} increased the number of positive cases from 26 to 34 (81\%) and identified ≥ 2 mutant alleles in 25 cases, compared with conventional {PCR}, which identified multiple {KRAS} mutant alleles in only 12 cases. A good correlation was observed between results obtained with tumor biopsies and those obtained with pancreatic juice.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Digital {PCR} provides a robust, quantitative measure of the proportion of {KRAS} mutant alleles in routinely obtained samples. It also allows a better classification of tumors, with potential clinical relevance.},

Digital {PCR} using microfluidics is a new approach that allows absolute quantification of {DNA} molecules. In this study, digital {PCR} was applied to environmental samples, and the effect of {PCR} inhibitors on {DNA} quantification was tested. In the control experiment using λ {DNA} and humic acids, underestimation of λ {DNA} at 1/4400 of the theoretical value was observed with 6.58 ng μL(-1) humic acids. In contrast, digital {PCR} provided accurate quantification data with a concentration of humic acids up to 9.34 ng μL(-1). The inhibitory effect of paddy field soil extract on quantification of the archaeal 16S {rRNA} gene was also tested. By diluting the {DNA} extract, quantified copy numbers from real-time {PCR} and digital {PCR} became similar, indicating that dilution was a useful way to remedy {PCR} inhibition. The dilution strategy was, however, not applicable to all natural environmental samples. For example, when marine subsurface sediment samples were tested the copy number of archaeal 16S {rRNA} genes was 1.04×10(3) copies/g-sediment by digital {PCR}, whereas real-time {PCR} only resulted in 4.64×10(2) copies/g-sediment, which was most likely due to an inhibitory effect. The data from this study demonstrated that inhibitory substances had little effect on {DNA} quantification using microfluidics and digital {PCR}, and showed the great advantages of digital {PCR} in accurate quantifications of {DNA} extracted from various microbial habitats.},

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using digital {PCR} for {NIPD} in pregnancies at risk of sickle cell anemia.
{METHODS}: Minor-groove binder ({MGB}) {TaqMan} probes were designed to discriminate between wild-type hemoglobin A and mutant (hemoglobin S) alleles encoded by the {HBB} (hemoglobin, beta) gene in {cffDNA} isolated from maternal plasma samples obtained from pregnancies at risk of sickle cell anemia. The fractional fetal {DNA} concentration was assessed in male-bearing pregnancies with a digital {PCR} assay for the Y chromosome-specific marker {DYS}14. In pregnancies with a female fetus, a panel of biallelic insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) markers was developed for the quantification of the fetal {DNA} fraction. We used digital real-time {PCR} to analyze the dosage of the variant encoding hemoglobin S relative to that encoding wild-type hemoglobin A.
{RESULTS}: The sickle cell genotype was correctly determined in 82\% (37 of 45) of male fetuses and 75\% (15 of 20) of female fetuses. Mutation status was determined correctly in 100\% of the cases (25 samples) with fractional fetal {DNA} concentrations {\textgreater}7\%.

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differential activity such as in gene expression is a major defeat in biostatistics and bioinformatics. Equally important, however much less frequently studied, is the question of similar activity from one biological condition to another. The fold-change, or ratio, is usually considered a relevant criterion for stating difference and similarity between measurements. Importantly, no statistical method for concomitant evaluation of similarity and distinctness currently exists for biological applications. Modern microarray, digital {PCR} ({dPCR}), and Next-Generation Sequencing ({NGS}) technologies frequently provide a means of coefficient of variation estimation for individual measurements. Using fold-change, and by making the assumption that measurements are normally distributed with known variances, we designed a novel statistical test that allows us to detect concomitantly, thus using the same formalism, differentially and similarly expressed genes (http://cds.ihes.fr). Given two sets of gene measurements in different biological conditions, the probabilities of making type I and type {II} errors in stating that a gene is differentially or similarly expressed from one condition to the other can be calculated. Furthermore, a confidence interval for the fold-change can be delineated. Finally, we demonstrate that the assumption of normality can be relaxed to consider arbitrary distributions numerically. The Concomitant evaluation of Distinctness and Similarity ({CDS}) statistical test correctly estimates similarities and differences between measurements of gene expression. The implementation, being time and memory efficient, allows the use of the {CDS} test in high-throughput data analysis such as microarray, {dPCR}, and {NGS} experiments. Importantly, the {CDS} test can be applied to the comparison of single measurements (N=1) provided the variance (or coefficient of variation) of the signals is known, making {CDS} a valuable tool also in biomedical analysis where typically a single measurement per subject is available.},

An example of an assessment that could benefit from such improved precision is the measurement of tumour-associated copy number variation ({CNV}) in the cell free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) fraction of patient blood plasma. To investigate the potential precision of {dPCR} and compare it with the established technique of quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}), we used breast cancer cell lines to investigate {HER}2 gene amplification and modelled a range of different {CNVs}. We showed that, with equal experimental replication, {dPCR} could measure a smaller {CNV} than {qPCR}. As {dPCR} precision is directly dependent upon both the number of replicate measurements and the template concentration, we also developed a method to assist the design of {dPCR} experiments for measuring {CNV}. Using an existing model (based on Poisson and binomial distributions) to derive an expression for the variance inherent in {dPCR}, we produced a power calculation to define the experimental size required to reliably detect a given fold change at a given template concentration.

	abstract = {Quantification of genomic {DNA} that is traceable to the {SI} was performed successfully by measuring the individual nucleotides. Specifically, ultrasound was used to shear lambda genomic {DNA} into fragments of less than 200 base pairs, followed by deoxyribonuclease Ι and phosphodiesterase Ι digestion and liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{IDMS}) quantification to estimate the mass fraction of the lambda {DNA}, based on the constituent deoxynucleotide monophosphates ({dNMPs}) within the molecule. Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) was employed to quantify the same lambda {DNA} solution to provide independent data for comparing the performance of two quantitative methods. On the basis of the {LC}-{IDMS} measurement after ultrasonic treatment of the sample, the concentration of lambda {DNA} was 273.1 ± 9.8 μg/g (expanded uncertainty at the 95\% confidence interval). This shows good agreement with the data from {dPCR}. Additionally, the result calculated on the basis of the sum of the concentrations of the four {dNMPs} is the same as that calculated on the basis of the sequence, which indicates that knowledge of the {DNA} sequence and length is unnecessary to measure the total {DNA} concentration when applying ultrasonic treatment-{LC}-{IDMS}.},

We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital {RNA}-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every {cDNA} molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After {PCR}, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and {cDNA} sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, {RNA} abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given {cDNA} sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and {PCR}-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital {PCR} but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional {RNA}-Seq.},

	abstract = {The existence of cell free {DNA} in the human circulatory system has been known since the 1950s, however, intensive research in this area has been conducted for the last ten years. This review paper brings a short overview of the existing literature concerning the cell free {DNA} research in various clinical fields and pathological states and considers the application possibilities of this new analyte in clinical laboratory diagnostics. At the moment, cell free {DNA} is most widely used for the purpose of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal sex or fetal {RhD} status. The recent discovery of epigenetic changes in placental/fetal {DNA} and the detection of fetal/placental-specific {RNAs} have made it possible to use this technology in all pregnancies irrespective of the gender of the fetus. With the application of new techniques such as next generation sequencing, digital {PCR} and mass spectrometry, it is now possible to detect very small amounts of specific {DNA} in the presence of excess of other nonspecific nucleic acids. Second most probable application is in oncology, where detection and monitoring of tumors is now possible by the detection of tumor-derived nucleic acids. Third promising field for near future implementation of this analyte is transplantation medicine, where free {DNA} level could serve as a marker of transplant rejection. Before any further utilization of this new biomarker, pre-analytical and analytical aspects of free {DNA} analysis remain to be standardized. In the field of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis, important ethical, legal and social questions remain to be discussed.},

{METHODS}: Through power equations, we modeled the number of wells necessary to determine the feasibility of digital {PCR} as a practical method for trisomy 21 risk assessment.
{RESULTS}: The number of wells needed is a direct correlate of the ability to isolate free fetal {DNA}. If a 20\% fetal {DNA} enhancement can be achieved, then 2,609 counts would be sufficient to achieve a 99\% detection rate for a 1\% false-positive rate and potentially feasible with readily available plates. However, if only a 2\% increase is seen, then 220,816 counts will be necessary, and over 110,000 would be needed just to achieve 95\% for a 5\% false-positive rate - both far beyond current commercially available technology.
{CONCLUSION}: There are several noninvasive prenatal diagnostic methods which may reach commercialization; all have differing potential advantages and disadvantages. Digital {PCR} is potentially a cheaper methodology for trisomy 21, but it is too early to determine the optimal method.},

Conventional technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) and immunohistochemistry, have produced conflicting results for {MCPyV} infections in non-{MCC} tumors. Therefore, we performed quantitative analyses of the {MCPyV} copy number in various skin tumor tissues, including {MCC} (n = 9) and other sun exposure-related skin tumors (basal cell carcinoma [{BCC}, n = 45], actinic keratosis [{AK}, n = 52], Bowen's disease [n = 34], seborrheic keratosis [n = 5], primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma [n = 5], malignant melanoma [n = 5], and melanocytic nevus [n = 6]). In a conventional {PCR} analysis, {MCPyV} {DNA} was detected in {MCC} (9 cases; 100\%), {BCC} (1 case; 2\%), and {AK} (3 cases; 6\%). We then used digital {PCR} technology to estimate the absolute viral copy number per haploid human genome in these tissues. The viral copy number per haploid genome was estimated to be around 1 in most {MCC} tissues, and there were marked differences between the {MCC} (0.119-42.8) and {AK} (0.02-0.07) groups. {PCR}-positive {BCC} tissue showed a similar viral load as {MCC} tissue (0.662). Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against the {MCPyV} T antigen ({CM}2B4) demonstrated positive nuclear localization in most of the high-viral-load tumor groups (8 of 9 {MCC} and 1 {BCC}), but not in the low-viral-load or {PCR}-negative tumor groups. These results demonstrated that {MCPyV} infection is possibly involved in a minority of sun-exposed skin tumors, including {BCC} and {AK}, and that these tumors display different modes of infection.},

In this study, we implemented and validated a relatively low cost nanofluidic system for {SNP}-{GT} with and without Specific Target Amplification ({STA}). As proof of principle, we first validated the effect of input {DNA} copy number on genotype call rate using well characterised, digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) quantified human genomic {DNA} samples and then implemented the validated method to genotype 45 {SNPs} in the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, nuclear genome. When {STA} was not incorporated, for a homozygous human {DNA} sample, reaction chambers containing, on average 9 to 97 copies, showed 100\% call rate and accuracy. Below 9 copies, the call rate decreased, and at one copy it was 40\%. For a heterozygous human {DNA} sample, the call rate decreased from 100\% to 21\% when predicted copies per reaction chamber decreased from 38 copies to one copy. The tightness of genotype clusters on a scatter plot also decreased. In contrast, when the same samples were subjected to {STA} prior to genotyping a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% were achieved. Our results demonstrate that low input {DNA} copy number affects the quality of data generated, in particular for a heterozygous sample. Similar to human genomic {DNA}, a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% was achieved with whale genomic {DNA} samples following multiplex {STA} using either 15 or 45 {SNP}-{GT} assays. These calls were 100\% concordant with their true genotypes determined by an independent method, suggesting that the nanofluidic system is a reliable platform for executing call rates with high accuracy and concordance in genomic sequences derived from biological tissue.},

The vast majority of cancer tissue samples are formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) which enables histopathological examination and long term archiving. However, {FFPE} cancer genomic {DNA} is oftentimes degraded and generally a poor substrate for many molecular biology assays. To overcome the issues of poor {DNA} quality from {FFPE} samples and detect oncogenic copy number amplifications with high accuracy and sensitivity, we developed a novel approach. Our assay requires nanogram amounts of genomic {DNA}, thus facilitating study of small amounts of clinical samples. Using droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}), we can determine the relative copy number of specific genomic loci even in the presence of intermingled normal tissue. We used a control dilution series to determine the limits of detection for the {ddPCR} assay and report its improved sensitivity on minimal amounts of {DNA} compared to standard real-time {PCR}. To develop this approach, we designed an assay for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene ({FGFR}2) that is amplified in a gastric and breast cancers as well as others. We successfully utilized {ddPCR} to ascertain {FGFR}2 amplifications from {FFPE}-preserved gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.},

In addition, most techniques theoretically appropriate for allelic discrimination depend on the specific identified sequence changes for assay design, need extensive optimization, or may not be suitable. We developed a method that does not fully depend on the specific nucleotide changes. It enables efficient assay design and practical implementation of allelic discrimination.
{METHODS}: : Digital polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) was used to separate and amplify alleles. Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to identify sequence changes.
{RESULTS}: : We developed a cost-effective digital {PCR} method for allelic discrimination of short amplicons and demonstrated it with p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in {GJB}2 as an example. We also successfully developed a long-range digital {PCR} approach to determine the cis-trans relationship of p.Arg117His and 5T in the {CFTR} gene.
{CONCLUSION}: : Digital {PCR} for allelic discrimination can be clinically implemented to determine the allelic configuration of relatively common sequence changes which frequently appear together and have clinical ramifications, such as the combination of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in the {GJB}2 gene and p.Arg117His and 5T in {CFTR}.},

This device then undergoes on-chip polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) amplification and fluorescence detection to digitally quantify the sample's nucleic acid contents. Wide-field fluorescence images are captured using a low cost 21-megapixel digital camera and macro-lens with an 8-12 cm(2) field-of-view at 1× to 0.85× magnification, respectively. We demonstrate both end-point and real-time imaging ability to perform on-chip quantitative digital {PCR} analysis of the entire droplet array.

	abstract = {In this paper, we are working toward a problem of great importance to global health: determination of viral {HIV} and hepatitis C ({HCV}) loads under point-of-care and resource limited settings. While antiretroviral treatments are becoming widely available, viral load must be evaluated at regular intervals to prevent the spread of drug resistance and requires a quantitative measurement of {RNA} concentration over a wide dynamic range (from 50 up to 10(6) molecules/{mL} for {HIV} and up to 10(8) molecules/{mL} for {HCV}). "Digital" single molecule measurements are attractive for quantification, but the dynamic range of such systems is typically limited or requires excessive numbers of compartments. Here we designed and tested two microfluidic rotational {SlipChips} to perform multivolume digital {RT}-{PCR} ({MV} digital {RT}-{PCR}) experiments with large and tunable dynamic range. These designs were characterized using synthetic control {RNA} and validated with {HIV} viral {RNA} and {HCV} control viral {RNA}. The first design contained 160 wells of each of four volumes (125 {nL}, 25 {nL}, 5 {nL}, and 1 {nL}) to achieve a dynamic range of 5.2 × 10(2) to 4.0 × 10(6) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution. The second design tested the flexibility of this approach, and further expanded it to allow for multiplexing while maintaining a large dynamic range by adding additional wells with volumes of 0.2 {nL} and 625 {nL} and dividing the {SlipChip} into five regions to analyze five samples each at a dynamic range of 1.8 × 10(3) to 1.2 × 10(7) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution. No evidence of cross-contamination was observed. The multiplexed {SlipChip} can be used to analyze a single sample at a dynamic range of 1.7 × 10(2) to 2.0 × 10(7) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution with limit of detection of 40 molecules/{mL}. {HIV} viral {RNA} purified from clinical samples were tested on the {SlipChip}, and viral load results were self-consistent and in good agreement with results determined using the Roche {COBAS} {AmpliPrep}/{COBAS} {TaqMan} {HIV}-1 Test. With further validation, this {SlipChip} should become useful to precisely quantify viral {HIV} and {HCV} {RNA} for high-performance diagnostics in resource-limited settings. These microfluidic designs should also be valuable for other diagnostic and research applications, including detecting rare cells and rare mutations, prenatal diagnostics, monitoring residual disease, and quantifying copy number variation and gene expression patterns. The theory for the design and analysis of multivolume digital {PCR} experiments is presented in other work by Kreutz et al.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital {PCR} ({MV} digital {PCR}) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital {PCR}. {MV} digital {PCR} minimizes the total number of wells required for "digital" (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12,000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the {SlipChip} platform. {MV} digital {PCR} was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 {nL} was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of {HIV} viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {\textless}500 molecules/{mL} to {\textgreater}1,000,000 molecules/{mL}), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of {DNA}. This approach simplifies digital {PCR} experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to {SlipChip} and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, {DOI}: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital {RT}-{PCR} devices for quantifying {RNA}.},

The inclusion of carrier had no effect on this estimated quantity, but did improve measurement precision. We report disagreement when using {dPCR} to measure different template types and when comparing the estimated quantities by {dPCR} and {UV} spectrophotometry. Finally, we also demonstrate that preamplification can impose a significant measurement bias.

By controlling chamber height to droplet diameter ratios we predictively control three-dimensional packing configurations with varying degrees of droplet overlap to increase droplet density and imaging sensor area coverage efficiency. Fluorescence imaging of the densely packed 3D reactor arrays, up to three layers high, demonstrates high throughput quantitative analysis of single-molecule reactions. Now a greater number of microreactors can be observed and studied in a single picture frame without the need for confocal imaging, slide scanners, or complicated image processing techniques. Compared to 2D designs, tunable 3D reactor arrays yield up to a threefold increase in density and use 100\% of the sensor's imaging area to enable simultaneous imaging a larger number of reactions without sacrificing digital quantification performance.

	abstract = {Somatic mutations within tumoral {DNA} can be used as highly specific biomarkers to distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts. These {DNA} biomarkers are potentially useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and follow-up of patients. In order to have the required sensitivity and specificity to detect rare tumoral {DNA} in stool, blood, lymph and other patient samples, a simple, sensitive and quantitative procedure to measure the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is required. However, techniques such as dual probe {TaqMan}(®) assays and pyrosequencing, while quantitative, cannot detect less than ∼1\% mutant genes in a background of non-mutated {DNA} from normal cells. Here we describe a procedure allowing the highly sensitive detection of mutated {DNA} in a quantitative manner within complex mixtures of {DNA}. The method is based on using a droplet-based microfluidic system to perform digital {PCR} in millions of picolitre droplets. Genomic {DNA} ({gDNA}) is compartmentalized in droplets at a concentration of less than one genome equivalent per droplet together with two {TaqMan}(®) probes, one specific for the mutant and the other for the wild-type {DNA}, which generate green and red fluorescent signals, respectively. After thermocycling, the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is determined by counting the ratio of green to red droplets. We demonstrate the accurate and sensitive quantification of mutated {KRAS} oncogene in {gDNA}. The technique enabled the determination of mutant allelic specific imbalance ({MASI}) in several cancer cell-lines and the precise quantification of a mutated {KRAS} gene in the presence of a 200,000-fold excess of unmutated {KRAS} genes. The sensitivity is only limited by the number of droplets analyzed. Furthermore, by one-to-one fusion of drops containing {gDNA} with any one of seven different types of droplets, each containing a {TaqMan}(®) probe specific for a different {KRAS} mutation, or wild-type {KRAS}, and an optical code, it was possible to screen the six common mutations in {KRAS} codon 12 in parallel in a single experiment.},

	abstract = {Quantitative polymerase chain reactions ({qPCR}) based on real-time {PCR} constitute a powerful and sensitive method for the analysis of nucleic acids. However, in {qPCR}, the ability to multiplex targets using differently colored fluorescent probes is typically limited to 4-fold by the spectral overlap of the fluorophores. Furthermore, multiplexing {qPCR} assays requires expensive instrumentation and most often lengthy assay development cycles. Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}), which is based on the amplification of single target {DNA} molecules in many separate reactions, is an attractive alternative to {qPCR}. Here we report a novel and easy method for multiplexing {dPCR} in picolitre droplets within emulsions-generated and read out in microfluidic devices-that takes advantage of both the very high numbers of reactions possible within emulsions ({\textgreater}10(6)) as well as the high likelihood that the amplification of only a single target {DNA} molecule will initiate within each droplet. By varying the concentration of different fluorogenic probes of the same color, it is possible to identify the different probes on the basis of fluorescence intensity. Adding multiple colors increases the number of possible reactions geometrically, rather than linearly as with {qPCR}. Accurate and precise copy numbers of up to sixteen per cell were measured using a model system. A 5-plex assay for spinal muscular atrophy was demonstrated with just two fluorophores to simultaneously measure the copy number of two genes ({SMN}1 and {SMN}2) and to genotype a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.815A{\textgreater}G, {SMN}1).

	abstract = {To digitally analyze expression levels of multiple genes in one reaction, we proposed a method termed as '{MDHB}' (Multiplexed Digital-{PCR} coupled with Hydrogel Bead-array). The template for bead-based emulsion {PCR} ({emPCR}) was prepared by reverse transcription using sequence-tagged primers. The beads recovered from {emPCR} were immobilized with hydrogel to form a single-bead layer on a chip, and then decoded by gene-specific probe hybridization and Cy3-{dUTP} based primer extension reaction. The specificity of probe hybridization was improved by using electrophoresis to remove mismatched probes on the bead's surface. The number of positive beads reflects the abundance of expressed genes; the expression levels of target genes were normalized to a housekeeping gene and expressed as the number ratio of green beads to red beads. The discrimination limit of {MDHB} is 0.1\% (i.e., one target molecule from 1000 background molecules), and the sensitivity of the method is below 100 cells when using the β-actin gene as the detection target. We have successfully employed {MDHB} to detect the relative expression levels of four colorectal cancer ({CRC})-related genes (c-myc, {COX}-2, {MMP}7, and {DPEP}1) in 8 tissue samples and 9 stool samples from {CRC} patients, giving the detection rates of 100\% and 77\%, respectively.

The clinical endpoint is the development of multiple tumours, either simultaneously or sequentially in the same epithelial surface. The mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear; one possible explanation is that the epithelium is colonized by a clonal population of cells that are at increased risk of progression to cancer. We now address this possibility in a short case series, using individual genomic events as molecular biomarkers of clonality. In squamous lung cancer the most common genomic aberration is 3q amplification. We use a digital {PCR} technique to assess the clonal relationships between multiple biopsies in a longitudinal bronchoscopic study, using amplicon boundaries as markers of clonality. We demonstrate that clonality can readily be defined by these analyses and confirm that field cancerization occurs at a pre-invasive stage and that pre-invasive lesions and subsequent cancers are clonally related. We show that while the amplicon boundaries can be shared between different biopsies, the degree of 3q amplification and the internal structure of the 3q amplicon varies from lesion to lesion. Finally, in this small cohort, the degree of 3q amplification corresponds to clinical progression.},

	abstract = {In this paper, digital quantitative detection of nucleic acids was achieved at the single-molecule level by chemical initiation of over one thousand sequence-specific, nanoliter isothermal amplification reactions in parallel. Digital polymerase chain reaction (digital {PCR}), a method used for quantification of nucleic acids, counts the presence or absence of amplification of individual molecules. However, it still requires temperature cycling, which is undesirable under resource-limited conditions. This makes isothermal methods for nucleic acid amplification, such as recombinase polymerase amplification ({RPA}), more attractive. A microfluidic digital {RPA} {SlipChip} is described here for simultaneous initiation of over one thousand {nL}-scale {RPA} reactions by adding a chemical initiator to each reaction compartment with a simple slipping step after instrument-free pipet loading. Two designs of the {SlipChip}, two-step slipping and one-step slipping, were validated using digital {RPA}. By using the digital {RPA} {SlipChip}, false-positive results from preinitiation of the {RPA} amplification reaction before incubation were eliminated. End point fluorescence readout was used for "yes or no" digital quantification. The performance of digital {RPA} in a {SlipChip} was validated by amplifying and counting single molecules of the target nucleic acid, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) genomic {DNA}. The digital {RPA} on {SlipChip} was also tolerant to fluctuations of the incubation temperature (37-42 °C), and its performance was comparable to digital {PCR} on the same {SlipChip} design. The digital {RPA} {SlipChip} provides a simple method to quantify nucleic acids without requiring thermal cycling or kinetic measurements, with potential applications in diagnostics and environmental monitoring under resource-limited settings. The ability to initiate thousands of chemical reactions in parallel on the nanoliter scale using solvent-resistant glass devices is likely to be useful for a broader range of applications.},

First, we confirmed the correlation of {dPCR} to conventional {RQ}-{PCR} using 30 patient samples with various minimal residual disease ({MRD}) levels.

Cell-free fetal {DNA} analysis in maternal plasma provides a noninvasive mean of assessing fetal sex in such pregnancies. However, the disease status of male fetuses remains unknown if mutation-specific confirmatory analysis is not performed. Here we have developed a noninvasive test to diagnose whether the fetus has inherited a causative mutation for hemophilia from its mother. The strategy is based on a relative mutation dosage approach, which we have previously established for determining the mutational status of fetuses for autosomal disease mutations. In this study, the relative mutation dosage method is used to deduce whether a fetus has inherited a hemophilia mutation on chromosome X by detecting whether the concentration of the mutant or wild-type allele is overrepresented in the plasma of heterozygous women carrying male fetuses. We correctly detected fetal genotypes for hemophilia mutations in all of the 12 studied maternal plasma samples obtained from at-risk pregnancies from as early as the 11th week of gestation.

Here we report digital {MDA} ({dMDA}), an ultrasensitive method for quantifying nucleic acid fragments of unknown sequence. We use the new assay to show that our custom φ29 {DNAP} preparation is free of contamination at the limit of detection of the {dMDA} assay (1 contaminating molecule per assay microliter). Contamination in commercially available preparations is also investigated. The results of the {dMDA} assay provide strong evidence that the so-called 'template-independent' {MDA} background can be attributed to high-molecular weight contaminants and is not primer-derived in the commercial kits tested. {dMDA} is orders of magnitude more sensitive than {PCR}-based techniques for detection of microbial genomic {DNA} fragments and opens up new possibilities for the ultrasensitive quantification of {DNA} fragments in a wide variety of application areas using {MDA} chemistry and off-the-shelf hardware developed for digital {PCR}.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Cell-free fetal {DNA} is a source of fetal genetic material that can be used for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Usually constituting less than 10\% of the total cell free {DNA} in maternal plasma, the majority is maternal in origin. Optimizing conditions for maximizing yield of cell-free fetal {DNA} will be crucial for effective implementation of testing. We explore factors influencing yield of fetal {DNA} from maternal blood samples, including assessment of collection tubes containing cell-stabilizing agents, storage temperature, interval to sample processing and {DNA} extraction method used.
{METHODS}: Microfluidic digital {PCR} was performed to precisely quantify male (fetal) {DNA}, total {DNA} and long {DNA} fragments (indicative of maternal cellular {DNA}). Real-time {qPCR} was used to assay for the presence of male {SRY} signal in samples.
{RESULTS}: Total cell-free {DNA} quantity increased significantly with time in samples stored in K(3){EDTA} tubes, but only minimally in cell stabilizing tubes. This increase was solely due to the presence of additional long fragment {DNA}, with no change in quantity of fetal or short {DNA}, resulting in a significant decrease in proportion of cell-free fetal {DNA} over time. Storage at 4 °C did not prevent these changes.
{CONCLUSION}: When samples can be processed within eight hours of blood draw, K(3){EDTA} tubes can be used. Prolonged transfer times in K(3){EDTA} tubes should be avoided as the proportion of fetal {DNA} present decreases significantly; in these situations the use of cell stabilising tubes is preferable. The {DNA} extraction kit used may influence success rate of diagnostic tests.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0015244},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The putative promoter of the holocarboxylase synthetase ({HLCS}) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues and could be detected as a fetal-specific {DNA} marker in maternal plasma. Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) has been demonstrated by an epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of hypermethylated {HLCS} in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome dosage reference marker. We explore if this method can be applied on both male and female fetuses with the use of a paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome dosage normalization.
{METHODOLOGY}: We quantified hypermethylated {HLCS} molecules using methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by real-time or digital {PCR} analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we compared the amount of digestion-resistant {HLCS} to that of a {SNP} allele (rs6636, a C/G {SNP}) that the fetus has inherited from the father but absent in the pregnant mother.
{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: Using a fetal-specific {SNP} allele on a reference chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T21 placental tissue samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference marker. We then analyzed 33 euploid and 14 T21 maternal plasma samples. All but one sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were correctly classified using the fetal-specific C allele, while correct classification was achieved for all samples using the fetal-specific G allele as the reference marker.
{CONCLUSIONS}: As a proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that the epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach can be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 for both male and female fetuses.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the potential for non-invasive diagnosis of a variety of human genetic diseases using cell-free {DNA} extracted from maternal plasma samples in early gestation. Such methods are of great significance to the obstetrics community because of their potential use as clinical standard of care. Proof of concept for such approaches has been established for aneuploidy and paternally inherited dominant traits. Although significant progress has recently been made, the non-invasive diagnosis of monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion is more problematic. Recent developments in microfluidic digital {PCR} and {DNA} sequencing have resulted in a number of recent advances in this field. These have largely, although not exclusively, been used for the development of diagnostic methods for aneuploidy. However, given their prevalence, it is likely that such methods will be utilized towards the development of non-invasive methods for diagnosing monogenetic disorders.
{RESULTS}: With this in mind, we have undertaken a statistical modeling of three contemporary (digital) analytical methods in the context of prenatal diagnosis using cell free {DNA} for monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion. We provide an experimental framework for the future development of diagnostic methods in this context that should be considered when designing molecular assays that seek to establish proof of concept in this field.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a {SlipChip} to perform digital {PCR} in a very simple and inexpensive format. The fluidic path for introducing the sample combined with the {PCR} mixture was formed using elongated wells in the two plates of the {SlipChip} designed to overlap during sample loading. This fluidic path was broken up by simple slipping of the two plates that removed the overlap among wells and brought each well in contact with a reservoir preloaded with oil to generate 1280 reaction compartments (2.6 {nL} each) simultaneously. After thermal cycling, end-point fluorescence intensity was used to detect the presence of nucleic acid. Digital {PCR} on the {SlipChip} was tested quantitatively by using Staphylococcus aureus genomic {DNA}. As the concentration of the template {DNA} in the reaction mixture was diluted, the fraction of positive wells decreased as expected from the statistical analysis. No cross-contamination was observed during the experiments. At the extremes of the dynamic range of digital {PCR} the standard confidence interval determined using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not satisfactory. Therefore, statistical analysis based on the score method was used to establish these confidence intervals. The {SlipChip} provides a simple strategy to count nucleic acids by using {PCR}. It may find applications in research applications such as single cell analysis, prenatal diagnostics, and point-of-care diagnostics. {SlipChip} would become valuable for diagnostics, including applications in resource-limited areas after integration with isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and visual readout.},

We confirm that the technique can be used to interrogate {DNA} from cell lines, fresh frozen material and {FFPE} samples to assess copy number variation. We show that as little as 5 ng of {DNA} is needed to generate a copy number karyogram, and follow this up with data from a series of {FFPE} biopsies and surgical samples. We have used various levels of sample multiplexing to demonstrate the adjustable resolution of the methodology, depending on the number of samples and available resources. We also demonstrate reproducibility by use of replicate samples and comparison with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ({aCGH}) and digital {PCR}.

	abstract = {This paper describes a very simple and robust microfluidic device for digitizing samples into an array of discrete volumes. The device is based on an inherent fluidic phenomenon, where an incoming aqueous sample divides itself into an array of chambers that have been primed with an immiscible phase. Self-digitization of sample volumes results from the interplay between fluidic forces, interfacial tension, channel geometry, and the final stability of the digitized samples in the chambers. Here, we describe experiments and simulations that were used to characterize these parameters and the conditions under which the self-digitization process occurred. Unlike existing methods used to partition samples into an array, our method is able to digitize 100\% of a sample into a localized array without any loss of sample volume. The final volume of the discretized sample at each location is defined by the geometry and size of each chamber. Thus, we can form an array of samples with varying but predefined volumes. We exploited this feature to separate the crystal growth of otherwise concomitant polymorphs from a single solution. Additionally, we demonstrated the removal of the digitized samples from the chambers for downstream analysis, as well as the addition of reagents to the digitized samples. We believe this simple method will be useful in a broad range of applications where a large array of discretized samples is required, including digital {PCR}, single-cell analysis, and cell-based drug screening.},

	abstract = {While the bulk of the finished microbial genomes sequenced to date are derived from cultured bacterial and archaeal representatives, the vast majority of microorganisms elude current culturing attempts, severely limiting the ability to recover complete or even partial genomes from these environmental species. Single cell genomics is a novel culture-independent approach, which enables access to the genetic material of an individual cell. No single cell genome has to our knowledge been closed and finished to date. Here we report the completed genome from an uncultured single cell of Candidatus Sulcia muelleri {DMIN}. Digital {PCR} on single symbiont cells isolated from the bacteriome of the green sharpshooter Draeculacephala minerva bacteriome allowed us to assess that this bacteria is polyploid with genome copies ranging from approximately 200-900 per cell, making it a most suitable target for single cell finishing efforts. For single cell shotgun sequencing, an individual Sulcia cell was isolated and whole genome amplified by multiple displacement amplification ({MDA}). Sanger-based finishing methods allowed us to close the genome. To verify the correctness of our single cell genome and exclude {MDA}-derived artifacts, we independently shotgun sequenced and assembled the Sulcia genome from pooled bacteriomes using a metagenomic approach, yielding a nearly identical genome. Four variations we detected appear to be genuine biological differences between the two samples. Comparison of the single cell genome with bacteriome metagenomic sequence data detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), indicating extremely low genetic diversity within a Sulcia population. This study demonstrates the power of single cell genomics to generate a complete, high quality, non-composite reference genome within an environmental sample, which can be used for population genetic analyzes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The {EGFR} [epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog, avian)] gene is known to harbor genomic alterations in advanced lung cancer involving gene amplification and kinase mutations that predict the clinical response to {EGFR}-targeted inhibitors. Methods for detecting such molecular changes in lung cancer tumors are desirable.
{METHODS}: We used a nanofluidic digital {PCR} array platform and 16 cell lines and 20 samples of genomic {DNA} from resected tumors (stages I-{III}) to quantify the relative numbers of copies of the {EGFR} gene and to detect mutated {EGFR} alleles in lung cancer. We assessed the relative number of {EGFR} gene copies by calculating the ratio of the number of {EGFR} molecules (measured with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled Scorpion assay) to the number of molecules of the single-copy gene {RPP}30 (ribonuclease P/{MRP} 30kDa subunit) (measured with a 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-labeled {TaqMan} assay) in each panel. To assay for the {EGFR} L858R (exon 21) mutation and exon 19 in-frame deletions, we used the {ARMS} and Scorpion technologies in a {DxS}/Qiagen {EGFR}29 Mutation Test Kit for the digital {PCR} array.
{RESULTS}: The digital array detected and quantified rare gefitinib/erlotinib-sensitizing {EGFR} mutations (0.02\%-9.26\% abundance) that were present in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of early-stage resectable lung tumors without an associated increase in gene copy number. Our results also demonstrated the presence of intratumor molecular heterogeneity for the clinically relevant {EGFR} mutated alleles in these early-stage lung tumors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The digital {PCR} array platform allows characterization and quantification of oncogenes, such as {EGFR}, at the single-molecule level. Use of this nanofluidics platform may provide deeper insight into the specific roles of clinically relevant kinase mutations during different stages of lung tumor progression and may be useful in predicting the clinical response to {EGFR}-targeted inhibitors.},

Recent advances in molecular techniques enable other applications of fetal {DNA} purified from maternal plasma samples. Chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. trisomy 21) can be diagnosed by digital {PCR}, which offers higher accuracy in quantifying {DNA} sequences than standard real-time {PCR}. Digital {PCR}, but also {MALDI}-{TOF}, are suitable for detecting point mutations, widening the spectrum of applications to monogenic diseases. The ongoing lowering of costs for massively parallel sequencing might lead to replacement of most of the other currently used approaches.

Regulatory authorities in the European Union ({EU}) have defined the labelling threshold for {GM} food on the copy number ratio between the transgenic event and an endogenous gene. Real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) is currently being used for quantification of {GM} organisms ({GMOs}). Limitations in real-time {PCR} applications to detect very low number of {DNA} targets has led to new developments such as the digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) which allows accurate measurement of {DNA} copies without the need for a reference calibrator. In this paper, the amount of maize {MON}810 and hmg copies present in a {DNA} extract from seed powders certified for their mass content and for their copy number ratio was measured by {dPCR}. The ratio of these absolute copy numbers determined by {dPCR} was found to be identical to the ratios measured by real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) using a plasmid {DNA} calibrator. These results indicate that both methods could be applied to determine the copy number ratio in {MON}810. The reported values were in agreement with estimations from a model elaborated to convert mass fractions into copy number fractions in {MON}810 varieties. This model was challenged on two {MON}810 varieties used for the production of {MON}810 certified reference materials ({CRMs}) which differ in the parental origin of the introduced {GM} trait.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Maternal plasma {mRNA} encoded by the {PLAC}4 gene (placenta-specific 4), which is transcribed from chromosome 21 in placental cells, is a potential marker for the noninvasive assessment of chromosome 21 dosage in the fetus. We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of 2 trisomy 21-screening approaches that use maternal plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA}.
{METHODS}: We studied maternal plasma samples from 153 pregnant women carrying euploid and trisomy 21 fetuses. For the samples in which the fetuses were heterozygous for the studied {PLAC}4 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}), we measured the ratio between 2 alleles of the {SNP} in maternal plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA} ({RNA}-{SNP}) by mass spectrometric ({MS}) and digital {PCR} methods. For pregnancies involving fetuses homozygous for the {SNP}, we quantified the total {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentration in maternal plasma by real-time {PCR} and digital {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: For the {RNA}-{SNP} approach, we achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% (95\% {CI}, 40.2\%-100\%) and 89.7\% (95\% {CI}, 78.8\%-96.1\%), respectively, for both the {MS} and the digital {PCR} methods. For the {mRNA}-quantification approach, the areas under the {ROC} curves were 0.859 (95\% {CI}, 0.741-0.903) and 0.833 (95\% {CI}, 0.770-0.923) for plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentrations measured by the real-time {PCR} and the digital {PCR} methods, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: For prenatal screening of trisomy 21, the quantification of the total {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentration can be used in a synergistic manner with the {RNA}-{SNP} allelic ratio approach to increase the population coverage of cases in which diagnostic information can be obtained.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: A digital {PCR} approach has recently been suggested to detect greater amounts of cell-free fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma than conventional real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}). Because the digital {qPCR} approach uses shorter {PCR} amplicons than the real-time {qPCR} assay, we investigated whether a real-time {qPCR} assay appropriately modified for such short amplicons would improve the detection of cell-free fetal {DNA}.
{METHOD}: We developed a novel universal-template ({UT}) real-time {qPCR} assay that was specific for the {DYS}14 sequence on Y chromosome and had a short amplicon size of 50 bp. We examined this "short" assay with 50 maternal plasma samples and compared the results with those for a conventional real-time {qPCR} assay of the same locus but with a longer amplicon (84 bp).
{RESULTS}: Qualitatively, both assays detected male cell-free fetal {DNA} with the same specificity and detection capability. Quantitatively, however, the new {UT} real-time {qPCR} assay for shorter amplicons detected, on average, almost 1.6-fold more cell-free fetal {DNA} than the conventional real-time {qPCR} assay with longer amplicons.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The use of short {PCR} amplicons improves the detection of cell-free fetal {DNA}. This feature may prove useful in attempts to detect cell-free fetal {DNA} under conditions in which the amount of template is low, such as in samples obtained early in pregnancy.},

	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2009.134114},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The use of fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 (T21) is an actively researched area. We propose a novel method of T21 detection that combines fetal-specific epigenetic and genetic markers.
{METHODS}: We used combined bisulfite restriction analysis to search for fetal {DNA} markers on chromosome 21 that were differentially methylated in the placenta and maternal blood cells and confirmed any target locus with bisulfite sequencing. We then used methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by microfluidics digital {PCR} analysis to investigate the identified marker. Chromosome-dosage analysis was performed by comparing the dosage of this epigenetic marker with that of the {ZFY} (zinc finger protein, Y-linked) gene on chromosome Y.
{RESULTS}: The putative promoter of the {HLCS} (holocarboxylase synthetase) gene was hypermethylated in the placenta and hypomethylated in maternal blood cells. A chromosome-dosage comparison of the hypermethylated {HLCS} and {ZFY} loci could distinguish samples of T21 and euploid placental {DNA}. Twenty-four maternal plasma samples from euploid pregnancies and 5 maternal plasma samples from T21 pregnancies were analyzed. All but 1 of the euploid samples were correctly classified.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The epigenetic-genetic chromosome-dosage approach is a new method for noninvasive prenatal detection of T21. The epigenetic part of the analysis can be applied to all pregnancies. Because the genetic part of the analysis uses paternally inherited, fetal-specific genetic markers that are abundant in the genome, broad population coverage should be readily achievable. This approach has the potential to become a generally usable technique for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.},

However, it remains to be determined how suitable these approaches are for the detection of more subtle fetal genetic alterations, such as those involved in hereditary Mendelian disorders (e.g., thalassemia and cystic fibrosis).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Next-generation {DNA} sequencing on the 454, Solexa, and {SOLiD} platforms requires absolute calibration of the number of molecules to be sequenced. This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input {DNA} can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate the use of digital {PCR} to accurately quantify 454 and Solexa sequencing libraries, enabling the preparation of sequencing libraries from nanogram quantities of input material while eliminating costly and time-consuming titration runs of the sequencer. We successfully sequenced low-nanogram scale bacterial and mammalian {DNA} samples on the 454 {FLX} and Solexa {DNA} sequencing platforms. This study is the first to definitively demonstrate the successful sequencing of picogram quantities of input {DNA} on the 454 platform, reducing the sample requirement more than 1000-fold without pre-amplification and the associated bias and reduction in library depth.
{CONCLUSION}: The digital {PCR} assay allows absolute quantification of sequencing libraries, eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves to {PCR}-based quantification, and with a coefficient of variation close to 10\%, is sufficiently precise to enable direct sequencing without titration runs.},

These two mutations account for {\textgreater}85\% of clinically important {EGFR} mutations associated with responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {DNA} samples were analyzed using a microfluidics system that simultaneously performed 9,180 {PCRs} at nanoliter scale. A single-mutant {DNA} molecule in a clinical specimen could be detected and the quantities of mutant and wild-type sequences were precisely determined.
{RESULTS}: Exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation were detectable in 6 (17\%) and 9 (26\%) of 35 pretreatment plasma samples, respectively. When compared with the sequencing results of the tumor samples, the sensitivity and specificity of plasma {EGFR} mutation analysis were 92\% and 100\%, respectively. The plasma concentration of the mutant sequences correlated well with the clinical response. Decreased concentration was observed in all patients with partial or complete clinical remission, whereas persistence of mutation was observed in a patient with cancer progression. In one patient, tyrosine kinase inhibitor was stopped after an initial response and the tumor-associated {EGFR} mutation reemerged 4 weeks after stopping treatment.
{CONCLUSION}: The sensitive detection and accurate quantification of low abundance {EGFR} mutations in tumor tissues and plasma by microfluidics digital {PCR} would be useful for predicting treatment response, monitoring disease progression and early detection of treatment failure associated with acquired drug resistance.},

Current methods for definitive diagnosis rely on invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. Fetal {DNA} has been found in maternal plasma but exists as a minor fraction among a high background of maternal {DNA}. Hence, quantitative perturbations caused by an aneuploid chromosome in the fetal genome to the overall representation of sequences from that chromosome in maternal plasma would be small. Even with highly precise single molecule counting methods such as digital {PCR}, a large number of {DNA} molecules and hence maternal plasma volume would need to be analyzed to achieve the necessary analytical precision. Here we reasoned that instead of using approaches that target specific gene loci, the use of a locus-independent method would greatly increase the number of target molecules from the aneuploid chromosome that could be analyzed within the same fixed volume of plasma. Hence, we used massively parallel genomic sequencing to quantify maternal plasma {DNA} sequences for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. Twenty-eight first and second trimester maternal plasma samples were tested. All 14 trisomy 21 fetuses and 14 euploid fetuses were correctly identified.

	abstract = {Most cancer genomes are characterized by the gain or loss of copies of some sequences through deletion, amplification or unbalanced translocations. Delineating and quantifying these changes is important in understanding the initiation and progression of cancer, in identifying novel therapeutic targets, and in the diagnosis and prognosis of individual patients. Conventional methods for measuring copy-number are limited in their ability to analyse large numbers of loci, in their dynamic range and accuracy, or in their ability to analyse small or degraded samples. This latter limitation makes it difficult to access the wealth of fixed, archived material present in clinical collections, and also impairs our ability to analyse small numbers of selected cells from biopsies. Molecular copy-number counting ({MCC}), a digital {PCR} technique, has been used to delineate a non-reciprocal translocation using good quality {DNA} from a renal carcinoma cell line. We now demonstrate {microMCC}, an adaptation of {MCC} which allows the precise assessment of copy number variation over a significant dynamic range, in template {DNA} extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical biopsies. Further, {microMCC} can accurately measure copy number variation at multiple loci, even when applied to picogram quantities of grossly degraded {DNA} extracted after laser capture microdissection of fixed specimens. Finally, we demonstrate the power of {microMCC} to precisely interrogate cancer genomes, in a way not currently feasible with other methodologies, by defining the position of a junction between an amplified and non-amplified genomic segment in a bronchial carcinoma. This has tremendous potential for the exploitation of archived resources for high-resolution targeted cancer genomics and in the future for interrogating multiple loci in cancer diagnostics or prognostics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The precise measurement of cell-free fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma facilitates noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies and other applications. We tested the hypothesis that microfluidics digital {PCR}, in which individual fetal-{DNA} molecules are counted, could enhance the precision of measuring circulating fetal {DNA}.
{METHODS}: We first determined whether microfluidics digital {PCR}, real-time {PCR}, and mass spectrometry produced different estimates of male-{DNA} concentrations in artificial mixtures of male and female {DNA}. We then focused on comparing the imprecision of microfluidics digital {PCR} with that of a well-established nondigital {PCR} assay for measuring male fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma.
{RESULTS}: Of the tested platforms, microfluidics digital {PCR} demonstrated the least quantitative bias for measuring the fractional concentration of male {DNA}. This assay had a lower imprecision and higher clinical sensitivity compared with nondigital real-time {PCR}. With the {ZFY}/{ZFX} assay on the microfluidics digital {PCR} platform, the median fractional concentration of fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma was {\textgreater} or =2 times higher for all 3 trimesters of pregnancy than previously reported.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Microfluidics digital {PCR} represents an improvement over previous methods for quantifying fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma, enabling diagnostic and research applications requiring precise quantification. This approach may also impact other diagnostic applications of plasma nucleic acids, e.g., in oncology and transplantation.},

Digital {PCR}, in which a {DNA} sample is analyzed in distributive fashion over multiple reaction chambers, allows for enumeration of discrete template {DNA} molecules, as well as sequestration of non-specific primer annealing templates into negative chambers, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in positive chambers. Here, we have applied digital {PCR} technology to bisulfite-converted {DNA} for single-molecule high-resolution {DNA} methylation analysis and for increased sensitivity {DNA} methylation detection. We developed digital bisulfite genomic {DNA} sequencing to efficiently determine single-basepair {DNA} methylation patterns on single-molecule {DNA} templates without an interim cloning step. We also developed digital {MethyLight}, which surpasses traditional {MethyLight} in detection sensitivity and quantitative accuracy for low quantities of {DNA}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The discovery of circulating cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma has opened up new possibilities for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. The potential application of this technology for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies is an aspect of this field that is being actively investigated. The main challenge of work in this area is the fact that cell-free fetal nucleic acids represent only a minor fraction of the total nucleic acids in maternal plasma. Methods and
{RESULTS}: We performed a review of the literature, which revealed that investigators have applied methods based on the physical and molecular enrichment of fetal nucleic acid targets from maternal plasma. The former includes the use of size fractionation of plasma {DNA} and the use of the controversial formaldehyde treatment method. The latter has been achieved through the development of fetal epigenetic and fetal {RNA} markers. The aneuploidy status of the fetus has been explored through the use of allelic ratio analysis of plasma fetal epigenetic and {RNA} markers. Digital {PCR} has been shown to offer high precision for allelic ratio and relative chromosome dosage analyses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: After a decade of work, the theoretical and practical feasibility of prenatal fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection by plasma nucleic acid analysis has been demonstrated in studies using small sample sets. Larger scale independent studies will be needed to validate these initial observations. If these larger scale studies prove successful, it is expected that with further development of new fetal {DNA}/{RNA} markers and new analytical methods, molecular noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of the major chromosomal aneuploidies could become a routine practice in the near future.},

	abstract = {Trisomy 21 is the most common reason that women opt for prenatal diagnosis. Conventional prenatal diagnostic methods involve the sampling of fetal materials by invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. Screening by ultrasonography and biochemical markers have been used to risk-stratify pregnant women before definitive invasive diagnostic procedures. However, these screening methods generally target epiphenomena, such as nuchal translucency, associated with trisomy 21. It would be ideal if noninvasive genetic methods were available for the direct detection of the core pathology of trisomy 21. Here we outline an approach using digital {PCR} for the noninvasive detection of fetal trisomy 21 by analysis of fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma. First, we demonstrate the use of digital {PCR} to determine the allelic imbalance of a {SNP} on {PLAC}4 {mRNA}, a placenta-expressed transcript on chromosome 21, in the maternal plasma of women bearing trisomy 21 fetuses. We named this the digital {RNA} {SNP} strategy. Second, we developed a nonpolymorphism-based method for the noninvasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21. We named this the digital relative chromosome dosage ({RCD}) method. Digital {RCD} involves the direct assessment of whether the total copy number of chromosome 21 in a sample containing fetal {DNA} is overrepresented with respect to a reference chromosome. Even without elaborate instrumentation, digital {RCD} allows the detection of trisomy 21 in samples containing 25\% fetal {DNA}. We applied the sequential probability ratio test to interpret the digital {PCR} data. Computer simulation and empirical validation confirmed the high accuracy of the disease classification algorithm.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Neurofibromatosis type 1 ({NF}1) is the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorder and it is associated with an elevated risk for malignant tumors of tissues derived from neural crest cells. The {NF}1 gene is considered a tumor suppressor gene and inactivation of both copies can be found in {NF}1-associated benign and malignant tumors. Melanocytes also derive from neural crest cells but melanoma incidence is not markedly elevated in {NF}1. In this study we could analyze a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a 15-year-old boy with {NF}1 for loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) within the {NF}1 gene. Neurofibromatosis in this patient was transmitted by the boy's farther who carried the mutation {NF}1 c. 5546 G/A.
{RESULTS}: Melanoma cells were isolated from formalin-fixed tissue by liquid coverslip laser microdissection. In order to obtain statistically significant {LOH} data, digital {PCR} was performed at the intragenic microsatellite {IVS}27AC28 with {DNA} of approx. 3500 melanoma cells. Digital {PCR} detected 23 paternal alleles and one maternal allele. Statistical analysis by {SPRT} confirmed significance of the maternal allele loss.
{CONCLUSION}: To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence of inactivation of both copies of the {NF}1 gene in a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a patient with {NF}1. The classical double-hit inactivation of the {NF}1 gene suggests that the {NF}1 genetic background promoted melanoma genesis in this patient.},

The technique is to amplify a single {DNA} template from minimally diluted samples, therefore generating amplicons that are exclusively derived from one template and can be detected with different fluorophores or sequencing to discriminate different alleles (e.g., wild type vs. mutant or paternal vs. maternal alleles). Thus, digital {PCR} transforms the exponential, analog signals obtained from conventional {PCR} to linear, digital signals, allowing statistical analysis of the {PCR} product. Digital {PCR} has been applied in quantification of mutant alleles and detection of allelic imbalance in clinical specimens, providing a promising molecular diagnostic tool for cancer detection.

In primary tumors, however, the analysis of {LOH} is fraught with technical problems that have limited its reproducibility and interpretation.

We here describe a new experimental approach, involving two components, to overcome these problems. First, a form of digital {PCR} was employed to directly count, one by one, the number of each of the two alleles in tumor samples. Second, Bayesian-type likelihood methods were used to measure the strength of the evidence for the allele distribution being different from normal. This approach imparts a rigorous statistical basis to {LOH} analyses, and should be able to provide more reliable information than heretofore possible in {LOH} studies of diverse tumor types.},
